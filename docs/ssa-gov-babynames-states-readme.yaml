  # State-specific data on the relative frequency of given names in the population of U.S. births where the individual has a Social Security Number

  **_(Tabulated based on Social Security records as of March 6, 2016)_**

  For each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia we created a file called SC.txt, where SC is the state's postal code.

  Each record in a file has the format: 2-digit state code, sex (M = male or F = female), 4-digit year of birth (starting with 1910), the 2-15 character name, and the number of occurrences of the name. Fields are delimited with a comma.

  Each file is sorted first on sex, then year of birth, and then on number of occurrences in descending order. When there is a tie on the number of occurrences names are listed in alphabetical order. This sorting makes it easy to determine a name's rank. The first record for each sex & year of birth has rank 1, the second record has rank 2, and so forth.

  To safeguard privacy, we restrict our list of names to those with at least 5 occurrences. If a name has less than 5 occurrences for a year of birth in any state, the sum of the state counts for that year will be less than the national count.
